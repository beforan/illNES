# illNES Assembly support files

This orphaned branch contains some MOS6502 assembly I wrote to test the original C++ CPU implementation.

It contains some binaries as well as the source at this time.

Maybe someday I'll dump the binaries and write a makefile or something for building them. I expect them to still be useful in testing future CPU implementations.

The source is mine, and so I'm able to license it under ISC if anyone wants it.
